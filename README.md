# Workout Tracker

This is a small application for me to track a few of my core exercises in the 
gym over the next several weeks to see if I am making progress in my new GVT
program.

Everything about this application is hosted locally on my mac. This is basically
going to be a glorified script that will allow me to track and display the 
progress of GVT.


## Commands
To track a workout for the day:
```
workout track
```

To show all of the progress:
```
workout show
```

To show the progress of a specific exercise:
```
workout show <EXERCISE>
```
